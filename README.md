Portfolio Webapp for Almost Typical Coding: Because portfolio websites are so 2015.

This is a React webapp designed to showcase my development abilities. The tech stack includes (so far):

- React
- React Router v4 (because trying out new tech is the name of the game)
- Express (will be used to serve the app from a Heroku app later on)
- Webpack
- SASS, using sass-loader and css-loader to integrate them with the bundle.

Future plans:

- Implement axios calls for API servers I've helped make, so that you can check their status from the home page.
- Go hogwild with the SASS and really create an awesome user experience.
- Optimise for mobile users.
